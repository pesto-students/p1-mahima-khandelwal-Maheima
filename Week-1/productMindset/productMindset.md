Netboard
Bridging the gap between online and offline classes. 

It provides a collaborative whiteboard for the users to jam together or make the classes more interesting and engaging. They say that it is important for students to be able to visualize what they are learning and remember how easier it used to be when the students were right in front of you and you had a blackboard/whiteboard when teaching them. You could draw diagrams easily, circle important things, etc very conveniently. But with the boom in online classes these days because of COVID, there came a screen between the two and on top of that jamming together became tougher than ever. It is not possible to provide physical boards at every teacher’s home but we sure can provide a virtual whiteboard at your house so, the teaching could be more streamlined, descriptive, and clear to the students. Not just that but you can ask your students to collaborate on that as well. 
Sharad, a teacher from kidze School says, “I felt restricted with the functionality of just me drawing on the screen, now my students are involved as well. The retention capacity in them has significantly increased”
