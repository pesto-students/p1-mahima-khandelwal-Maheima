A web browser's primary function is to render HTML, the code that is used to design or “mark up” web pages. When a browser loads a web page, it processes the HTML, which may contain text, links, and references to images and other items like CSS and JavaScript functions.

The browser's main components are:

1. User interface: Includes navigation buttons, address bar. Basically every part of browser except window of the requested page.

2. Browser enginer: Actions between UI and rendering engine

3. Rendering engine: Display requested content. 

4. Networking: Making http requests using different implementations on different platform behind the platform independent interface.

5. UI backend: used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. Exposes generic interface that isnn't platform specific

6. JS interpreter: Parse and execute JS

7. Data storage: Save data in cookies, local storage etc
